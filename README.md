# ECE355Lab

## Info: 
When you work on any functions or piece of code, please upload it as a separate file (don't update any code that you havent worked on the same day here) and add comments
so we have a proper record of what's what.

## Naming convention:
For proper record keeping, when you are uploading new code, please have at the top of the code a comment that states what you worked on and when.
